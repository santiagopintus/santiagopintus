## Current knowledge:

I have advanced expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and TypeScript, currently focused on developing with Next.js, which I really enjoy for its capabilities and TypeScript integration. I also work with tools and libraries like SASS for styling, Bootstrap for responsive design, Material UI for accessible and modern components, and Redux for efficient state management. Git is my preferred version control tool, helping me maintain code integrity and collaborate effectively on projects.
